//! This library primarily provides a binding and API for OpenCV 3.x.
//!
//! This is a work-in-progress and modules/functions are implemented as
//! needed. Attempts to use
//! [rust-bindgen](https://github.com/servo/rust-bindgen) or
//! [cpp_to_rust](https://github.com/rust-qt/cpp_to_rust) haven't been very
//! successful (I probably haven't tried hard enough). There is another port
//! [opencv-rust](https://github.com/kali/opencv-rust/) which generates OpenCV
//! bindings using a Python script.
