## Background

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library: http://opencv.org) is an
open-source BSD-licensed library that includes several hundreds of computer
vision algorithms. It's mainly developed in C++. This library provides Rust
bindings to access OpenCV functionalities. First, C bindings are created
(in [native](native) folder); then [Rust APIs](src/lib.rs) are constructed
atop. Although this manual process seems an inefficient process, it has served
me well as a learning experience to both OpenCV and Rust. In terms of OpenCV API
coverage, modules and functions are implemented as needed.

Please check out the [documentation](https://nebgnahz.github.io/cv-rs/cv/) to
see what has been ported. If you have demand for porting specific features,
please open an issue, or better create a PR.

Attempts to use [rust-bindgen](https://github.com/servo/rust-bindgen)
or [cpp_to_rust](https://github.com/rust-qt/cpp_to_rust) haven't been very
successful (I probably haven't tried hard enough). There is another
port [opencv-rust](https://github.com/kali/opencv-rust/) which generates OpenCV
bindings using a Python script (more automated).

## Install

Before anything, make sure you have OpenCV 3 installed. Read this
[Introduction to OpenCV][opencv-intro] to get started.

Then in any Rust project, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
cv = { git = "https://github.com/nebgnahz/cv-rs.git" }
```

And add this to your crate:

```
extern crate cv;
use cv::*;
```

And then, enjoy the power of OpenCV.

If you'd like to use OpenCV GPU functions, it's inside `cv::cuda`. Enable it
with the following code in `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies.cv]
git = "https://github.com/nebgnahz/cv-rs"
features = [ "gpu" ]
```

### Windows

Depending on your install, you have to set `%OPENCV_DIR%` and
`%OPENCV_LIB%` environment variables such that `%OPENCV_DIR%\include` points to
the OpenCV includes diretory (for example, it could be `C:\opencv\build`) and `%OPENCV_LIB%` points to `%OPENCV_DIR%\x64\<vc14 or vc15>\lib`, which has `opencv_world<version_number>.lib`. You
will also need to add `%OPENCV_DIR%\bin` to the `%PATH%`. If you are using `gnu` toolchain you will also need to add `MinGW` to the `PATH`. This path could look like `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-7.2.0-posix-seh-rt_v5-rev1\mingw64\bin`.

## Usage

See available examples on how this library might be used.

- [Display Image](examples/display_image.rs)
- [Video Capture](examples/video_capture.rs), optional GPU code
- [Face Detection](examples/face_detect.rs)
- [Camshift](examples/camshift.rs)
- [HOG Detection](examples/hog.rs), optional GPU code

## Contribute

See [the contribute file](contribute.md)! PRs highly welcome.

You may also simply open up an issue for feature/porting request.

Small note: If editing the README, please conform to the
